# `About Sanctuary`
![Alt text](frontend/images/current_home_page.png)

## This project is being made to emulate the AirBnb web application. Rebrand to "SANCTUARY" since users will be requesting safe haven from the outdoors through a monetary exchange. At the moment, CRUD for two features have mostly been completed thus far. Locations and Reviews features are set to test their full CRUD capabilities. Home page gives you quck access to brief preview of the spot and its pricing. Clicking anywhere on the spot image or body description takes you to a further detail route with information on that spot. Here you can see reviews, make reviews, as well as delete said reviews and said spot if logged in as the owner. Both home page and spot details page have access to a nav bar at top where you can always view user profile options(login etc), create a new listing for a sanctuary, and as well as quicly navigate back to home page. Users can now create bookings for each spot land manage those bookings using user prfile dropdown.

## TLDR: To deploy project copy link and download repo to your local system. Utilize npm install in both front and back end directories. Run all necessary migrations and seeders in the backend before starting up both backend and front end servers with "npm start".

The main technologies utiilized for this project are React and Redux for front end creation, sequel and sequelize for back end api integration, and Javascript as the primary language.
